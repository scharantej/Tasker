 ## Flask Application Design for a To-Do List using Vue.js

### HTML Files

**1. index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- It includes the necessary Vue.js and Flask dependencies and serves as the container for the Vue.js application.

**2. todo-list.html**
- This HTML file contains the Vue.js component responsible for displaying the to-do list.
- It includes the logic for adding, removing, and marking items as complete.

### Routes

**1. @app.route('/')**
- This route serves the index.html file, which loads the Vue.js application.

**2. @app.route('/add_item', methods=['POST'])**
- This route handles the addition of a new item to the to-do list.
- It receives the item's description from the Vue.js application and adds it to the database.

**3. @app.route('/remove_item/<int:item_id>', methods=['POST'])**
- This route handles the removal of an item from the to-do list.
- It receives the item's ID from the Vue.js application and removes it from the database.

**4. @app.route('/mark_complete/<int:item_id>', methods=['POST'])**
- This route handles the marking of an item as complete in the to-do list.
- It receives the item's ID from the Vue.js application and updates the database accordingly.

**5. @app.route('/get_items', methods=['GET'])**
- This route handles the retrieval of all items from the to-do list.
- It fetches the items from the database and returns them to the Vue.js application.

### Additional Notes

- The database mentioned in the routes can be implemented using any preferred database technology, such as SQLite or PostgreSQL.
- The Vue.js application can be developed using any preferred Vue.js framework or library, such as Vue 3 or Vuetify.
- The design provided here is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation may require additional logic and functionality based on specific requirements.
